# Machine_Learning_Project1

The project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect android malware using the Android Malware Dataset (CIC-AndMal2017) dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/android-malware-detection?select=Android_Malware.csv). The dataset contains a collection of benign and malware samples of Android applications. The machine learning model will be trained on this dataset to identify and classify Android applications as either benign or malicious.

To begin, the dataset will be preprocessed to extract useful features and remove irrelevant data. Then, several machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting will be trained on the preprocessed dataset to identify patterns and classify the Android applications. The performance of the trained models will be evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The project will also explore different techniques to improve the accuracy of the machine learning model. For instance, the dataset may be augmented with additional data, or the models may be fine-tuned with hyperparameter tuning to improve their performance.

Once the model is developed, it can be used to scan new Android applications and identify whether they are benign or malicious. This can help in detecting and preventing Android malware infections on user devices, thereby improving the overall security of Android devices. The results of this project can be applied in real-world scenarios such as antivirus software, security solutions, and malware detection systems.
